# Clip Bee

Unlike other clipboard history extensions, which will only show the clipboard history of VS Code, this extension can display your entire system clipboard history.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important
 For this app to work you need to first install the [companion desktop app](https://github.com/nithinpeter/clip-bee/tree/master/electron-app) (Currently only supports Mac. It is a simple Electron App, shouldn't be too hard to release a version for Windows/Linux. Contributions are welcome ü¶Å). ClipBee desktop app records the clipboard history in-memory, all history is gone üí®when you exit the app.
